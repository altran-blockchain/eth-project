# eth-project
A sample Ethereum smart contract to show the uses of blockchain
This folder contains two projects -  
* A simple Solidity based smart contract called Wrestler
* The other one is a full distributed app called pet-shop. Its taken from the tutorial with added comments - I'll be modifying this to make Hermes Blockchainve
* It's a nice starting point for whatever blockcahin you have
